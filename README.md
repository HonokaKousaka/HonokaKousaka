Hello. I am currently working on algorithms and statistics. 

**My works: Coresets for Deletion-Robust k-Center Clustering (Short Research Paper accepted, CIKM 2024)**

If you are interested in my work, please contact: reli@stu.ecnu.edu.cn

Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English / Japanese are okay!

**I am also focusing on dealing with bullying, gender discrimination, domestic violence and Chinese-style education. If you need emotional and sentimental assistance or even formal help because of any circumstance mentioned above, feel free to contact me.**
